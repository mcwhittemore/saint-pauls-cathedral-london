## Intro

We often talk about what we are programing, be it our cool new projects or some slick framework. Sometimes we talk about how and then quickly find ourselves in religous wars about which text editor is the best. Recently we've been talking alot about who is programing and how we can mitigate biasis in our communities that exclude people. A few years back it was really common to talk about when we program, though this seems to have fadded. But we don't often talk about why we program. People say they do it because they love it. People say they do it because its a job. Most of the time I think we all agree is a love/hate work/play combo, but this doesn't really anwser the question of why we program. It merely surface deep. I'm not going to try anwser why we program today. I think we're too caught up in cycle of love/work/hate/play to do this yet. Today, instead, I'm going to present my most recent why and expound on how prgraming from this different point of view has helped me continue to enjoy programing at my heights of hating it.
